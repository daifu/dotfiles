Directory
=========
At first, I am assuming you save this dotfiles in your directory under ~/bin

Setup
=========
Then, let's modify the .bash_profile and .bashrc in the directory: ~/
Use your favor text editor to edit, for example, I use mvim to edit them, so
$ mvim ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile

Add the following line to .bashrc:
. ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc

Add the following lines to .bash_profile:
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ];
then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi

Environment
===========
Execute env file:
source ~/bin/dotfiles/bash/env

After that you should echo $PATH, and you should see ....:/Users/[your username]/bin at the end of the line

Then you should good to go and add your favorite configuration to dotfiles.

Dependency
==========
You might not have vcprompt, and you should checkout xvzf/vcprompt in github:
Here are the installing procedure:

$ git clone git://github.com/xvzf/vcprompt.git
$ cd vcprompt
$ python setup.py install

VIM
===========
ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim

Add this line to the .vimrc:
source ~/bin/dotfiles/vimrc
