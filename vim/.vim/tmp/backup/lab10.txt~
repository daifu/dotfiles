After reading an article from UCLA Linux Users Group (http://linux.ucla.edu/lugwiki/resources:linux-security-how-not-to-get-hacked), I learnt some 
important and intro knowledge to keep my linux operating system more secure, such as disabling unused services in my linux system, keeping the safety codes
from social engineering, and continually keeping track of bleeding edge security issues on linux. At first, we should try to avoid using the telnet (insecure
remote shell) service, which can disable some hackers to connect to your computer with telnet insecurely. The instruction for editing the services on the website is not for Ubuntu. After I googling, I found out 
a correct way to do it in Ubuntu as follow. In order to disable all those insecure services at the Ubuntu, users should install xinetd (sudo apt-get install 
xinetd), then edit the file xinetd.conf, and then restart the command xinetd to apply the changes in the system (sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart). Secondly, 
the most secure servers or computers will be attacked easily by hackers because users used insecure way to organize their password and username, such 
as using “password” or their name or birthday or any information about the users as password. Maybe users passed out their password and username without verifying 
other people’s identities. Lastly, we should always stay aware of the latest news on security developments on Ubuntu, such as following a security mailing 
list (likes BugTraq) and applying security updates for your Ubuntu. After viewing the security issues, I found out the latest vulnerability on browsers 
using WebKit, which is “WebKit Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability”, and the successful attacks will allow attackers to execute arbitrary 
code within the context of the application. Unfortunately, there is no solution for this vulnerability currently. What we can do right now is keep track 
of the updates from the mailing list and try not to use WebKit browsers. Finally, It is crucial to keep our computers secure everyday and it can avoid 
a lot of troubles later on.
