(* EXCEPTIONS *)

(* This is a marker for places in the code that you have to fill in.
   Your completed assignment should never raise this exception. *)
exception ImplementMe of string

(* This exception is thrown to indicate an error during typechecking
   (e.g., a name has not been declared before it is used).
   The string should provide an error message.
*)
exception TypeError of string

(* This exception is thrown when an error occurs during evaluation
   (e.g., attempting to invoke something that's not a function).
   The string should provide an error message.
*)
exception EvalError of string

(* This exception is thrown when pattern matching fails during evaluation. *)  
exception MatchFailure  



(* EVALUATION *)

(* See if a value matches a given pattern.  If there is a match, return
   an environment for any name bindings in the pattern.  If there is not
   a match, raise the MatchFailure exception.

   - only integers match integer patterns, and only if the values agree
   - only booleans match boolean patterns, and only if the values agree
   - any value matches the wildcard pattern
   - any value matches the variable pattern
     and additionally creates a new name binding
   - only tuples match tuple patterns, and only if they have the
     same length and each component value matches the associated pattern
   - otherwise pattern matching failures
